## Question

- Why put in front of the file name `_` or `_` in **scss**/**css**?
  - The `_ (underscore)` is a partial for scss. That means the stylesheet its **going to be imported** (`@import`) to a main stylesheet i.e. styles.scss. The advantage on using partials is that you can use many files to **organize** your code and everything will be compiled on a single file.
